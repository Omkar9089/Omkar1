<p>* Unlimited membership with a variety of roles that grant different levels of access to the organization and its data</p>
<p>* The ability to give members a range of access permissions to your organization's repositories</p>
<p>* Nested teams that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions</p>
<p>* The ability for organization owners to view members' two-factor authentication (2FA) status</p>
<p>* The option to require all organization members to use two-factor authentication</p>
