<h1> Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request</h1> 
<p> 
In a pull request, you can review and discuss commits, changed files, and the differences (or "diff") between the files in the base and compare branches.
</p> 
<h2> About reviewing pull requests</h2> 
<p>
You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed. After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or request additional changes by submitting your review with a summary comment.
</p>

<h3>Reviewing dependency changes</h3>
<p>
If the pull request contains changes to dependencies you can use the dependency review for a manifest or lock file to see what has changed and check whether the changes introduce security vulnerabilities. For more information, see "Reviewing dependency changes in a pull request."
</p>
<p>1. On the pull request, click  Files changed.</p>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-tabs-changed-files.png">

<p>2. On the right of the header for a manifest or lock file, display the dependency review by clicking the  rich diff button.</p>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/dependency-review-rich-diff.png">

<p>3.You may also want to review the source diff, because there could be changes to the manifest or lock file that don't change dependencies, or there could be dependencies that GitHub can't parse and which, as a result, don't appear in the dependency review.
</p>
<br>
To return to the source diff view, click the  button.
