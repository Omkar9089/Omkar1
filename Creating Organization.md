# Github Organization

## About
Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features.

### Organizations include:

* A free option, GitHub Free, with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with full features and unlimited private repositories with limited features.
* The option to upgrade to GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud for additional features, including sophisticated user authentication and management, and escalated support options. For more information, see "GitHub's products."
* Unlimited membership with a variety of roles that grant different levels of access to the organization and its data
* The ability to give members a range of access permissions to your organization's repositories
* Nested teams that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions
* The ability for organization owners to view members' two-factor authentication (2FA) status
* The option to require all organization members to use two-factor authentication
* The option to purchase a license for GitHub Advanced Security and use the features on private repositories. For more information, see "About GitHub Advanced Security."

## Create an organization from scratch

When you create a new organization from scratch, it doesn't have any repositories associated with it. For more information on adding repositories to your organization, see "Creating a new repository" and "Transferring a repository."
